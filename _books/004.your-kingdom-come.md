### About the book

We are living in a very exciting time in human history. God is doing something so amazing and so miraculous that it goes beyond our wildest thoughts and dreams. Isaiah 43:18-19 is being fulfilled before our very eyes! Millions of people from major religious groups are choosing to follow Jesus as their Savior and risen King. Right where you are, there may be someone of these least-reached groups - like a Muslim neighbor, a Hindu medical doctor, a Buddhist work colleague, or a Shinto friend in your university class. You are unsure how to start bringing the Good News to that person and their family.This book will introduce seven strategic keys that can help you towards becoming an effective witness, and a blessing to these unreached people and their families in your natural sphere of influence.
