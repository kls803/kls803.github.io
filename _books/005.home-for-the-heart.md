### About the book

By 1901, new elaborate Harvey House resort hotels have been built along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, and Fred Harvey’s legacy is carried on by his sons. Twenty-year-old Liz Gilbertson, orphaned as a child, yearns to find her real father’s family. After being jilted by her fiance, she decides to become a Harvey Girl to give her life direction. When Michael McKey, the youngest son of a prominent Boston Banker, moves to Topeka to work as an accountant for Liz’s adopted father at the AT&SF office, her life takes a definite positive shift. Liz and Michael are drawn to each other, but can Liz rival the women of his social status?
