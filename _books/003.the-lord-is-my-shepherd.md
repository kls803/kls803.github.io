### About the book

Without a rival among the songs that reach the heart, the Twenty-third Psalm is the greatest poem ever penned in any language. It reigns supreme in circles of highest culture and in the humble homes of the lowly. It sounds all the chords of human experience, from depths of sorrow to heights of joy, taking us beside waters of stillness and into the strife of the enemy’s country, covering all the days of our life down here, and reaching into eternity. This exposition ... is intended to help Christians to enter into a life of victory by believing the gracious revelation of the Psalm of Victorious Life. Thus may we become sheep of his pasture in whom others may read the message of the Shepherd Psalm. — from the author’s foreword
