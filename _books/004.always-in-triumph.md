### About the book

Robert C. McQuilkin became the first president of Columbia International University (then Columbia Bible School) in 1923 and served until his death in 1952. As he began his tenure, McQuilkin was already well-known as the associate editor of the influential "Sunday School Times" and a Victorious Life Testimony conference speaker. As McQuilkin accepted the position to lead the school he wrote, "What a mighty power for missions and for soul-winning evangelism the school may be!" This book follows the life and calling of this dynamic leader.
