### About the book

There are many reasons why the parables of Jesus have gripped the human heart and why they have especially claimed the attention and careful study of Christians. They are matchless gems of teaching. No study will ever exhaust them. The parables of Jesus are simple and yet deeply profound. A child can understand and be gripped by the story. Yet those who know most of the Bible and who are students of life will continue to find new riches and depth in the parables. In this classic work, Robert C. McQuilkin writes about seventeen parables, giving a framework for understanding their meaning and drawing out principles for daily life.
