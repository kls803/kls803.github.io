### About the book

The message and truths found in the book of Romans are foundational to the Christian life. In this classic exposition, Robert C. McQuilkin’s passion for the Scriptures shines through as he seeks to help Christians “dig into” Romans for themselves, entering into its inner spirit and understanding God’s abounding grace that provides power to walk in newness of life.
