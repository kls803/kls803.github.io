### About the book

Robertson McQuilkin explores the issues behind why many Christians donâ€™t experience a "normal" Christian life, which is seen in the New Testament as a life of victory, peace, and joy. Instead, many Christians tend to live and behave like morally upright non-Christians, without the vibrancy and victory of a life that centers around constant, personal companionship with Christ. McQuilkin takes a balanced approach, examining the divine and human aspects of sanctification, as well as a roadmap back to experiencing a normal Christian life as God intended.
