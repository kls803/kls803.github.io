### About the book

Written for the 50th anniversary of Columbia Bible College, this book by former board Member, Rev. R. Arthur Mathews, beautifully captures the history of the school (now Columbia International University) from 1923 to 1973. With the rare qualifications of a Bible expositor, missionary statesman, seasoned writer, and author, Rev. Arthur Mathews ably achieved a twofold objective. He singled out the milestones of history, and at the same time underscored the message of faith and victory which continues to make CIU what it is today.
