### About the book

A Kansas Harvey Girl who wants to save her family farm in Missouri falls for a surveyor on the AT&SF railroad. He has to lead a survey team in the Oklahoma Territory. Will the distance and time apart or other circumstances come between them? Will they allow God to work in their lives and bring them back together?
