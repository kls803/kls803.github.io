### About the book

This is a newly reformatted version of the classic devotional by Octavius Winslow, containing twelve chapters on those things which are precious to God: Christ, faith, trials, God’s thoughts, the divine promises, the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, Christ’s blood, God’s children, God’s Word, prayer, Christ’s sympathy with our infirmities, and the death of the saints. This devotional treasure will warm the soul and reignite the heart with love for Christ.
