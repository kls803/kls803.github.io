### About the book

Biblical leadership is a high calling. It is also an adventure like no other. Much like organizing a mountain climbing expedition, leading isnâ€™t always easy. The task of stepping out boldly and with character may even feel beyond what we have to offer, but the result is worth the effort. This compilation of timeless leadership truths from Dr. Mark Smith is a reminder of the awe-inspiring and world-changing impact of leading above and beyond, following the example of Christ.
