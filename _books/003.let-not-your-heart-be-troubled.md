### About the book

In this classic book, the founder of Columbia International University, Robert C. McQuilkin, writes about the timeless appeal of the fourteenth chapter of John. Down through history, Christians have been drawn to the message "let not your heart be troubled." McQuilkin expounds on the abundant resurrection life that is so evident in this passage of Scripture. "John fourteen," he writes, "is a revelation of life from Him who is the Life."
