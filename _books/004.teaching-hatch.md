### About the book

The more one knows of the Word of God and the nature of God’s redemptive workings, the more clear it becomes that teaching is key to the process. The process of salvation could be described as God calling an individual into relationship, so that he might teach them of himself and bring their very identity into alignment with this own. The theme of teaching flows through the entire narrative of the Bible, and it is clear that those who would be involved with what God is doing must be involved with teaching others. In this classic book, teacher and counselor James M. "Buck" Hatch lays out a biblical framework for teaching that is in alignment with God’s redemptive methods and purposes.
