### About the book

The First Term provides practical help for those going to the mission field, especially during the first term. The book provides tips on what to do, how to live, and how to use time wisely for learning the language, beginning ministry, and caring for a family in a cross-cultural environment. This book is also for church leaders and missionary supporters, who will be able to share in and learn from the real-life experiences of a missionary family during their first term through preparation for furlough.
