### About the book

During much of the twentieth century, to consider having conversations about Christian faith with Chinese students and professionals was unheard of, but today there are virtually unlimited opportunities for Christians in America to share Christ with Chinese students and scholars. This book gives insight and guidance from research and experience to encourage engagement in this God-given opportunity to “Give Christ to China’s Future Leaders.”
