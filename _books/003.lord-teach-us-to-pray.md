### About the book

The Lord's Prayer, Robert C. McQuilkin writes, was not primarily as a prayer to be prayed by great congregations, nor for ritual use, but in answer to the request, “Lord, teach us to pray.” It’s a model for how we can approach God, as his children, praying alongside of the heart of the Father. It helps align our vision with God’s Kingdom and at the same time assures us of God’s loving provision and care.
