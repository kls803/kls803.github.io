### About the book

Robert C. McQuilkin writes about the five “victory” commands of Jesus in the New Testament, all of which are centered around the single word in the original text that has often been translated “Be of Good Cheer.” This particular word, he writes, “is a command to have peace and joy and rest and gladness and comfort and strength. It is a command to conquer discouragement, disappointment, despondency, or despair.” It’s a timeless message that’s just as relevant today as when it was written.
