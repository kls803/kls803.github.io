Tallgrass Media was started in 2007 as the freelance design business of Kelly Smith. He was born and raised on the plains of Kansas, and studied journalism at Kansas State University. The name Tallgrass Media is an homage to those roots.

Over the years, we've done many custom website projects for small businesses, non-profit organizations, churches, and educational institutions. We also provide full-service graphic design and branding consultation. Our first book publishing project was completed in 2001, and since that time we've been involved in many projects, providing editing, interior and cover design, ebook conversion, ISBN registration, print setup with CreateSpace and Amazon, as well as coordinating audiobook development.
